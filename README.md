# React Aria Components and TanStack Table Integration

This repository demonstrates the integration of [React Aria Components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html) and [TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table/v8), focusing on creating advanced, accessible table components in React. React Aria Components offers a collection of headless UI components, focusing on standardization and accessibility. TanStack Table provides a headless UI toolkit for building dynamic tables.

Additionally, the project utilizes:

- [React](https://react.dev/): For building user interfaces.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): For type-safe JavaScript development.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): For fast frontend builds.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) For utility-first styling.
- [Tailwind CSS Prettier Plugin](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss): For CSS classes sorting.
- [React Aria Components Tailwind CSS Plugin](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/styling.html#plugin): For shorter modifier names.
